# VR-room

---

Project created on Unity as my first ever VR scene. I am using it mainly to test and know how VR development works and it was made using some parts of the VR Development course on Unity Learning. 

## What is this room about

At this scene, you will find a room with a bunch of stuff to interact with, some apples, balls, rackets, hats and hooks to place your hat collection.

You can also put the hats on your head to have some style. 

Besides these cool interactions, there is a functional analog clock to inform you at what time Japan is. And, if you have trouble reading that, you can use a functional magnifying glass to help you see small things.

## Technologies

- Unity 2022.3
- XR Tool kit
